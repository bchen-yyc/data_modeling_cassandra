### Cassandra Data ModelingÂ¶

This project created a pipeline to read event data in CSV format from a local folder, process them in Pandas data frame and write them into Cassandra based on different queries.

Unzip the event_data.zip file in the same folder as the .ipynb file and start the data_modeling_cassandra.ipynb file in jupyter notebook.
